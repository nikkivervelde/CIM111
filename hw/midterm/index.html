        Kanye West has yet to release his new album "Yandi", even though it was meant
        to be released in Novemeber. His wife, Kim Kardashian, hinted that the ablum would
        be released in Novemeber on social media. Yet kanye fans were disapointed when nothing was
        shown on the day itself. Kanye tweeted with an apology, stating that he is taking his time
        to make the perfect album. His label and his friends have made no comments to this, refusing to
        get involved. The album is rumoured to feature artists such as J.Cole, Chance the Rapper, Pusha T, Jay Z and
        Travis Scott. In addition to award winning artists, the album will also include collabortions with internation artists
        and young choir groups. Kanye believes that music needs to go back to roots in order to fully appreacitate the art. He has been
        seen working with church groups in Chicago while also meeting arists in Nairobi,Kenya.
